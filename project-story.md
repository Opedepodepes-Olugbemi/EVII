# About EVII

## Inspiration

The inspiration for EVII came from observing a growing disconnect in our digital age: while we're more connected than ever, genuine emotional support remains surprisingly inaccessible. We noticed that:

- Traditional therapy is often expensive and hard to access
- People need emotional support at unpredictable times
- Many feel uncomfortable sharing feelings with others
- Current AI solutions lack emotional intelligence

We wanted to create something that could bridge this gap â€“ an AI companion that doesn't just chat, but truly understands and responds to emotional nuances.

## What it does

EVII is an emotional intelligence interface that:

- Analyzes voice emotions in real-time using Hume AI
- Displays emotional patterns through elegant visualizations
- Provides a responsive 3D avatar for natural interaction
- Offers a safe space for emotional expression
- Maintains conversation history for emotional journey tracking
- Adapts to user preferences with dark/light mode
